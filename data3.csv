"No, the GOP House and Senate were too busy automatically blocking any progress, even if it benefitted their own",D
Some of grounding for us to start the conversation on Kenyans to be armed and probably have a better regulation regime on gun ownership,R
We shouldn‚Äôt be forced to live in USA when Canada is passing laws to stop gun sales now and possibly gun ownership later.,D
"Many of us comment from afar. Distance gives perspective. Uncontrolled gun ownership with few checks, seems crazy to us. We live in countries where mass shootings are rare. It appears illogical and immoral to us to combat mass shootings with 'thoughts and prayers' only.",D
Gun ownership strongly correlates with NRA revenues and deaths. That's all everyone needs to know.,D
"Question for an idiot: Where do stolen guns come from?
Answer to idiot: Guns purchased legally then stolen. Proves 2 points: 1) Gun ownership doesn‚Äôt reduce crime like 2A nutz  argue.
2) Gun ownership increases crime: theft of guns, use to commit further crime.
Enforcing gun laws",D
"Actually, they do still have guns. 
Highly regulated laws surrounding gun ownership though",R
She's thin skinned and ill tempered. She refused to answer hard questions and own her position except for gun ownership. Pathetic,N
The second amendment without stricter gun control laws and responsible ownership is an obvious recipe for disaster and our reality today!,R

Gun ownership does not mean more crime. Wyoming leads the nation in guns and is one of the safest states to live in with nearly 70% gun ownership.,R

That's really good that you can defend yourself. Most people can't. That's why gun ownership is an equalizer.,R
"I'm not talking about conclusions here - I'm talking about the raw data and obvious conclusions that can be drawn, without political biases.",N
It's really telling how when they thought the uvalde shooter was trans so many 'makes sense' posts came about but I haven't heard the right bring forward more attention to mental health crisis and gun ownership since,R
Uhhh read the entire decision. It spoke to state rights to control gun ownership and militia membership. It was overturned in 2010 by McDonald v Chicago. Source for your snippet?,R
Because we don't punish law abiding citizens for the crimes of others. Gun ownership is our right...time to accept that.,R
Fascists try to restrict the public from owning fire arms. Nazis restricted gun ownership in the name of ‚Äúpublic safety.‚Äù The first American Gun Control laws were passed in the South to prevent African Americans from owning guns. Glad to know that you‚Äôre a closet racist.,D
"That's a very urban perspective.

I'm in favor of big changes to gun policy, but I'm not against private ownership of guns.

Personally, the biggest change I'd make is requiring insurance. The insurance companies would do what the legislature doesn't have the stomach for.",R
I know. We‚Äôll fix this with the 2024 election. Oregon just passed a stringent law on gun ownership and banned high-capacity magazines. üôèüèª,R
"You are right. Rampant gun ownership, with absolutely no responsibility, really is dangerous. 

At lest we can agree on something.",N
"Buy back all registered guns, only members of gun clubs or police can have a weapon. All others automatically illegal. Would never work in the US, because you are all a well disciplined militia, &amp; will use a document like to the bible to justify continued 21st century ownership.",D
Wouldn't be so much as ownership of a BB gun without a permit in this country.....,R
If you mean in the USA that might help. To me gun ownership with some limits is not a problem. Yet every school massacre seems like the alarm is going off underwater.,D
"Hey gun boy, do something more than pray, be presidential and change your laws.  Restrict ownership.  Only a republican can sell it to the 2A loons.  Just DO IT",R
"You are exercising your free speech rights on media that was only invented 40 years ago. BTW the anti gun fanatics are comically wrong. There were multi shot guns, not just muskets,  in existence when the Bill of Rights forbade the government from infringing on gun ownership.",D
Restricting gun ownership in this country is equally as difficult and (basically) impossible as restricting free speech. It‚Äôs just not going to happen. The best thing you can do is protect children at school In other ways. That‚Äôs really the only solution.,R
"Why, just because I don't value inanimate objects as much as I value human lives? I think you miss the point of gun ownership, ultimately it is to protect, or in some cases for subsistence, but its not a vanity thing. You can own many firearms and still not be a gun humper.",D
"Australia allowed gun ownership and revoked it after too many deaths. In addition, the constitution was written before technology existed that is now causing the problem. It's outdated and that can be fixed at some point.",D
"For our American friends - Australia has not ""melted down all our guns"" or ""given our rights away"". Gun ownership remains legal in Australia under strict conditions. Also Australia ranks 8th on the world freedom index, America ranks 15th, so there's that.",R
"Again, the comparison doesn‚Äôt make any sense. They have never had individual gun ownership and especially don‚Äôt have an explicit clause in their constitutions about it.",D
"‚ÄúWell regulated‚Äù is more than likely in regard to the organization, funding and mobility of state militias, not the regulation of actual individual, physical gun ownership and citizen purchasing power.",D
"But without a gun, that person is a lot less dangerous.  In the UK, gun ownership is limited and gun deaths almost never happen.",D
"It surely has nothing to do with the gun itself. America has had essentially limitless gun ownership for 250 years, and these shootings are clearly specific to the 21st century.",D
"Gun ownership does hold back this tide, which is why Texas and Florida are still conservative (not perfect...I said conservative).",D
"Incorrect, people who are against gun control understand the importance of an armed society. Far more lives are saved each year by legal gun ownership than lives taken by guns.",R
"The way she equates gun ownership and freedom scares me. Like many here, the p",D
"Facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings. Sorry. History, statistics and constitutional rights back up the positives of gun ownership. When you result to attack the individual instead of the argument. You can just admit you are wrong and move on. Easily that way for you.",R
Sounds like God's love is the kind that causes you to fail a background check for gun ownership.,R
"No, no it isn‚Äôt.
For a start, firearms like the Puckle Gun had been available for decades prior.
Also, private ownership of cannons and other naval ordnance was allowed post-war.
That and if the 2nd doesn‚Äôt apply to modern firearms, then the 1st doesn‚Äôt apply to computers.",N
Got any solutions? I wasn‚Äôt suggesting ban persay. But that we need to focus ok the problem that is male gun ownership seems to be a real issue. As is completed suicides.  Even male toddlers are 75% more likely to shoot themselves on accident.,D
There are roughly 77.49 million adult gun owners in the US.,N
I think the issue is how people (mostly cons) interpret it. The second amendment guarantees the right of the united states to form a military to defend the state it actually never had anything to do with citizen gun ownership. Even the SCOTUS never interpreted it that way.,N
"Data shows that states with stricter gun laws ‚Äî such as California, Hawaii, New York, and Massachusetts ‚Äî generally experience lower firearm mortality rates.

There are also higher rates of mass shootings in states with higher rates of gun ownership, research suggests""",D

"Maybe it‚Äôs time to start requiring psychological evaluations for holding political office, like Japan does f",N
"In fact, after the civil War, various laws were passed to prevent gun ownership by black folks specifically because white folks (The majority) were afraid they would get guns and rebel. The second Amendment is no protection from the majority.",D
So voting ISN‚ÄôT a right and we need to make it harder. But gun ownership IS a right and we need to make it easier so every asshat can have multiple guns?,R
"Males shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to own a weapon until age 28. Then, weekly therapy for the duration of gun ownership. Of course, the guns should have digital fingerprint unlocking technology. And no one should own an AR or similar device - particularly males.",D
Read the history of the formation of this country. Those words were written in a treasonous act that defied a kings rule. The only thing protecting them against that rule was gun ownership and defying limitations on individual rights. You take those things away and the gov rules,R
Gun ownership should be a requirement for a citizen. At least one per household with required gun safety course.,R
"We have.  Its been going down as gun ownership right have expanded.

"Gun ownership is a right, yet A-holes like you want to take that right.",R
"This is nonsensical. Following the logic of the statement, the right to gun ownership assumes the owner will shoot a student. It‚Äôs the same as saying the right to car ownership (which isn‚Äôt even constitutionally guaranteed) does not supersede a student‚Äôs right to not be run over.",R
"I'm trying my best to explain to you that leftist gun ownership isn't just about LARPing, it's about people wanting to protect their own lives in a world where school shootings and Jan 6th and Kyle Rittenhouse exist. But you seem to just think that guns are ontologically evil.",R
"I support gun control, but we're realistically never going to have a complete ban of gun ownership in this country. Radical right-wingers will want to use guns to commit violent acts because they already do that, as I'm sure you know. Therefore, some leftists want to own guns.",D
"So, they want to eliminate LEGAL gun ownership to prevent mass shootings.  Wouldn't that be like eliminating legal car o",R
Why do you support 2A and gun ownership by any and all adults?,D
And what in your lifetime have you needed your gun to defend yourself from?  And how many lives have you saved with your gun ownership?   And why does you having a gun trump in your mind a mother burying their 7 year old shot to death?,D
"The way she equates gun ownership and freedom scares me. Like many here, the proliferation of guns makes me feel more fear than freedom.",D
How will banning private ownership of handgun stop illegal importation of crime guns. Ask yourself this all street drugs illegal but you can find them in our schools even in prisons.  If we can‚Äôt keep banned drugs out of prisons how can we hope to ban gun,R
"You make ""shall not be infringed"" sound like something holy. Quit worshipping gun ownership.",D
"Yes. A trigger makes trigger happy. But, you might need it. So, I‚Äôm all for zen meditation gun ownership.",R
"You‚Äôre wrong. Metal detectors don‚Äôt make most people feel safer. 

Conservatives are obsessed with guns BECAUSE they are fearful. Every other developed country that experienced a mass shooting ‚Äî mostly just a single instance ‚Äî immediately significantly curtailed gun ownership.",D
"If you really want to ‚Äúlift up the community,‚Äù then disavow the NRA and lead the passage of reasonable gun laws that will keep your citizens and those in neighboring communities -who suffer from VA‚Äôs lax gun ownership laws- safer. Do you have such strength? Not at all.",N

That‚Äôs bullshit! You do realize I‚Äôm 100% ALL GUN LAWS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL &amp; ILLEGAL!But that meme is BULLSHIT! The Constitution defined &amp; provided for funding Militia! Sam Adams insisted on protecting private ownership of firearms so individual would be protected from militia,R
Medical study finds that legal gun ownership does not increase crime and may decrease it.),R

"Joel shouldn't be allowed to vote.

"abortion claims 600K+ a year, 'gun' homicide is ~20k (CDC) or 9.7k (FBI)  , ~400 from 'mass shootings'.   I'd bet &gt;50%+ of the whats left is gang  related. End the war on drugs, end most 'gun violence'. You want to end gun ownership though, not save lives.",R
"He‚Äôs exploiting fear of American issue to create a wedge issue at the expense of a minority of Canadians 

We have entirely different set of laws &amp; approach to gun ownership
Never on a trajectory to have this problem

Gun ownership is a Constitutionally protected right. Focus on the bad actors and the causes of their violence if you really want to reduce violence.,R
"You're welcome to ur opinion, but unless &amp; until you can get enough of the nation to share it to use the Amendment process (change 2A) or legislative process (change US Code 246), the law is what the law is.  Even ur own interpretation of 2A results in widespread gun ownership.",R
"Wrong.  Your assertion doesn‚Äôt take into account that gun ownership per capita has been decreasing since its high in the 70‚Äôs.  Nor does it explain why AR‚Äôs have only recently become popular for mass shooters, when it‚Äôs been widely available since the 60‚Äôs.  Ask yourself why",D
Hey women maybe you wouldn't lose your rights overnight if you had a gun Just saying. Men outnumber women as far as gun ownership in this country by many magnitudes and that's no one's fault but your own.,R
"I am not opposed to rational gun ownership at all. I also couldnt agree that across the board, weapons/guns are fetishized, taboo-ized, sensationalized, and omnipresent in entertainment. Maybe violence and confrontation in general is too much a centerpiece. It's weird.",R

They do. They support legal gun ownership,R
"Do you not realize that gun ownership is at the lowest point in American history, there are more regulations governing American‚Äôs 2nd amendment rights than ever before, yet you fear guns more than the politicians looking to take the right that comes right after #1 away??? ü§°üåé",R
"This is completely nonsensical reasoning.

Gun ownership in U.S. far greater than difference in homicide rate, so murders more frequent in countries with fewer guns.

Not to mention: homicide is already illegal. Doesn't prevent murder.

Basic math and fact-finding disproves you.",R
"30+ Americans killed in #RiotsAreNotProtests across our country.. We had them for months near me, in the middle of Covid (when we had rules limiting gathering; yet rioters were excused) Completely changed my mind on (big city) police &amp; gun ownership. My eyes are wide open now.",D
"Gun death/injury comes in a number of forms: murder, suicide, accident and negligence. There's relevant info and studies conducted on all these issues. I'm surprised that counties with a high incidence of gun ownership don't teach proper firearm handling and storage.",D

What does fascist mean? Republicans are the party of free speech. I don't remember fascist being in favor of free speech. I don't remember fascist being in favor of citizen gun ownership. If they had been then the Jews wouldn't have been quite so vulnerable in Poland.,R
